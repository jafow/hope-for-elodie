### What She's facing
Elodie is a brilliant, beloved little girl who suffers from a rare mutation
along the [PIK3CA gene](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PIK3CA), resulting in
abnormal growth in various cells in her body. In her it has caused a condition
known as *intestinal lymphangiectasia*.

Intestinal lymphangiectasia is a disorder where the lymphatic vessels supplying the
lining of the small intestine are dilated and malformed. This leads to a lot of serious health complications like:

*   malabsorption of nutrients;
*   a severely compromised immune system;
*   chronic diarrhea;
*   protein loss & vitamin deficiencies;
*   painful swelling of the face, abdomen and limbs.

### How we care for her
Management of intestinal lymphangiectasia for many patients consists of an
extremely low fat diet and regular IV infusions of a blood protein called
albumin. But Elodie's case is so severe that she cannot tolerate any food. Her
sole source of nutrition is a special medical formula called Vivonex Pediatric.
She's never tasted ice cream, or pizza, or birthday cake. She has to endure
regular hospitalizations, countless blood draws and IV infusions.

Despite all this, Elodie remains a loving, kind, highly sensitive and perceptive
child who loves animals, fairies, angels, and singing all day long. She has a
stunning memory, a perfectionist streak, and a precise mind for detail. She
enjoys nothing more than cuddling in bed discussing the various attributes of
birds, butterflies, planets and My Little Ponies.

### How you can help

Although it is prescribed by her doctor and is a medical necessity, our insurance refuses to pay for her medical formula, Vivonex Pediatrics, and for her required supplements. Our out of pocket cost for these is currently over $9,600 a year.
