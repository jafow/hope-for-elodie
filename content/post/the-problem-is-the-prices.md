# Medical Bills Are Too High

Please read *Sarah Kliff's* excellent piece on the enormous price differences
between hospitals: [The Problem is the
Prices](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/16/16357790/health-care-prices-problem)


In it, Sarah shares some of our story of receiving a crushing $22,000 bill from
Stanford Children's health, and she reports how hospitals are able to set
their own steep prices for treatments.
